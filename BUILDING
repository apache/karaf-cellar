Building Apache Karaf Cellar
============================

Initial Setup
-------------

1) Install Java 11 SDK (or later)

2) Make sure that your JAVA_HOME environment variable is set to the newly installed
   JDK location, and that your PATH includes %JAVA_HOME%\bin (windows) or
   $JAVA_HOME$/bin (unix).

3) Install Maven 3.9.x (or later), which can be downloaded from
   http://maven.apache.org/download.html. Make sure that your PATH includes
   the MVN_HOME/bin directory.


Building
--------

1) Download and uncompress the Apache Karaf Cellar source distribution.

2) Change to the top level directory of Apache Karaf Cellar uncompressed source distribution.

3) Run

         $> mvn clean install

   This will compile Apache Karaf Cellar and run all of the tests in the
   Apache Karaf Cellar source distribution.

4) Apache Karaf Cellar is now present in your local maven repository. Read the README file
   to install Cellar into a running Apache Karaf instance.
