h1. Cellar cloud discovery

Cellar relies on Hazelcast (http://www.hazelcast.com) in order to discover cluster nodes. This can happen either by using multicast or by unicast (specifying the ip address of each node).
Unfortunately multicast is not allowed in most IaaS providers and the alternative of specifying all IP addresses creates maintenance difficulties, especially since in most cases the addresses are not known in advance.

Cellar solves this problem using a cloud discovery service powered by jclouds (http://www.jclouds.org).

h2. Cloud discovery service

Most cloud providers provide cloud storage among other services. Cellar uses the cloud storage via jclouds, in order to determine the IP addresses of each node so that Hazelcast can find them.

This approach is also called blackboard and refers to the process where each node registers itself in a common storage are so that other nodes know its existence.

h2. Installing Cellar cloud discovery service

To install the cloud discovery service simply install the appropriate jclouds provider and then install cellar-cloud feature.
Amazon S3 is being used here for this example, but the below applies to any provider supported by jclouds.

{code}
features:install jclouds-aws-s3
features:install cellar-cloud
{code}

Once the feature is installed, you're required to create a configuration that contains credentials and the type of the cloud storage (aka blobstore).
To do that add a configuration file under the etc folder with the name org.apache.karaf.cellar.cloud-<provider>.cfg and place the following information there:

provider=aws-s3 (this varies according to the blobstore provider)
identity=<the identity of the blobstore account>
credential=<the credential/password of the blobstore account)
container=<the name of the bucket>
validity=<the amount of time an entry is considered valid, after that time the entry is removed>

After creating the file the service will check for new nodes. If new nodes are found the Hazelcast instance configuration will be updated and the instance restarted.
