= OSGi Event Broadcasting support (eventadmin)

Apache Karaf Cellar is able to listen all OSGi events on the cluster nodes, and broadcast each events to other nodes.

== Enable OSGi Event Broadcasting support

OSGi Event Broadcasting is an optional feature. To enable it, you have to install the cellar-eventadmin feature:

----
karaf@root()> feature:install cellar-eventadmin
----

== OSGi Event Broadcast in action

As soon as the cellar-eventadmin feature is installed (on all nodes that should use the clustered eventadmin),
Cellar listens all OSGi events, and broadcast these events to all nodes of the same cluster group.
